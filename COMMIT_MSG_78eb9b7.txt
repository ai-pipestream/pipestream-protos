refactor: Remove unused GraphNode transport configuration fields

BREAKING CHANGE: Remove transport fields from GraphNode and related messages

- Remove GraphNode.transport (field 7) - TransportConfig type
- Remove GraphNode.kafka_output_topic (field 11) - string type  
- Remove TransportConfig, GrpcConfig, MessagingConfig messages entirely
- Update GraphNode field numbers after removals (shifted down by 1-2)
- Remove transport field references from graph_repository_service.proto
- Update config/README.md to remove TransportConfig references
- Update CHANGELOG.md with breaking change documentation

Rationale: Transport configuration moved to GraphEdge for edge-based routing.
These node-level fields were unused in the codebase. Pipeline sinks now serve
as datasources for other pipelines instead of kafka_output_topic approach.

Migration: Regenerate protos due to field renumbering and removal.
